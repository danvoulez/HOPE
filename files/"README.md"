# VOX: Multi-Agent Orchestrator for AgentOS

## High-Level Concept

### Multiple Specialized Agents
Instead of having just a single AI agent, Vox coordinates a suite of specialized “sub-agents.” Each sub-agent focuses on a different domain—like _InventoryAgent_ (managing product stock, RFID data), _VideoAgent_ (handling media uploads and face recognition), _AccessAgent_ (controlling user access & logins), etc.

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Vox can invoke LLM-based reasoning with explainable intermediate steps. Each sub-agent has its own “context” or “memory,” while Vox acts as a meta-coordinator.

### Dynamic Tool Usage
Agents can call each other or external services—like sending WhatsApp messages, updating a database, or processing a video on a NAS—via a “tool layer” that Vox exposes.

### Event-Driven Flow
Vox uses an internal or external message bus (e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka, or even Socket.IO) to capture events from the entire AgentOS (RFID scans, video uploads, new user signups) and forwards them to the relevant sub-agents.

### Adaptive & Self-Optimizing
Over time, the sub-agents store results in a persistent memory (e.g. MongoDB), letting them refine thresholds or re-tune strategies (like “inventory reorder level” or “suspicious access detection”).

## Multi-Agent Architecture Overview

```lua
+-----------------+
|   AgentOS UI    |
|  (React, Vue)   |
+--------+--------+
         |
         v
+--------+--------+              +-----------------+
|        Vox       |  <------->  |   Tools Layer   | e.g. DB, WhatsApp
| Orchestrator     |  <------->  |   (HTTP, REST)  |
+--------+--------+
         |
+-----------+-----------+
|           |           |
v           v           v
+--------+  +--------+  +--------+
|VideoAgent|  |RfidAgent|  |AuthAgent|
+--------+  +--------+  +--------+
  (LLM)       (LLM)       (LLM)
```

1. Vox (central orchestrator) receives an event (e.g. “RFID tag detected” or “video uploaded”).
2. Based on the event type, Vox decides which sub-agent(s) to notify.
3. Sub-agent(s) then run chain-of-thought reasoning with the relevant context.
4. If they need more info—like user data from DB, or they want to place an order—they call the “tools layer” (or other sub-agents).
5. Results are returned to Vox, which logs them and triggers any follow-up events or notifications.

## Sample Python Code: Vox with Multi-Agent Flow

Below is a simplified example in Python that uses the OpenAI library to run multiple agents in a single orchestrator. You can run this as `python vox_orchestrator.py`. (You’ll need to install openai or whichever LLM client you’re using.)

## What’s Happening Here?

- **VoxOrchestrator** is a simple class that keeps an `agent_map` dict. For each “event type,” we have a specialized sub-agent function.
- When `handle_event(...)` is called, Vox picks the correct agent function and passes in the event context.
- That agent function calls the LLM (OpenAI ChatCompletion) with some system and user messages, instructing the model to reason step-by-step.
- We store the entire chain-of-thought text (which may end in JSON) in the orchestrator’s logs.
- In a real system, we’d parse the final JSON from the agent’s response to do next steps (e.g. send WhatsApp, update a DB, or create a new record).

## Real-World Adaptations
- **Messaging**: Instead of calling `handle_event(...)` in code, you might integrate with Kafka or RabbitMQ so that external microservices can publish events to the “vox” queue.
- **Security**: Each sub-agent might run in a container with only the privileges needed. Vox could pass them tokens or credentials as required.
- **Stateful Memory**: For more advanced adaptation, each sub-agent might keep an internal memory in a database, letting them recall past interactions.
- **Scaling**: If your enterprise environment is large, you’d run multiple copies of Vox behind a load balancer, each instance pulling from a queue. The DB or message broker ensures consistency.

## Why This Matters
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Dividing responsibilities among domain-focused agents keeps the architecture clean. You don’t have one giant “monolithic” AI; you have specialized sub-AIs that Vox coordinates.
- **Chain-of-Thought, Step-by-Step**: By using system and user messages, plus requesting a final JSON plan, you get both explainable intermediate reasoning and a machine-readable output.
- **Enterprise-Grade Flexibility**: You can integrate RFID, camera streams, user access logs, and more. Each domain can have an agent with its own logic. Vox unifies everything under one orchestrator.
- **Tool Invocation**: In real usage, you’d parse the agent’s final JSON and call external APIs or microservices. The agent might say: “Send alert via WhatsApp to user X” or “Save partial video frames to S3,” etc.
- **Scalable, Modular**: Because Vox is just orchestrating, you can add or remove sub-agents as your system grows. You can even chain them (e.g. output from RfidAgent triggers a call to InventoryAgent).

## Conclusion
Vox is no longer just a single agent “brain”—it’s a multi-agent orchestrator that:
- Leverages advanced LLM capabilities (chain-of-thought).
- Integrates multiple specialized sub-agents (RFID, video, authentication, finance, etc.).
- Dispatches events from across the entire AgentOS (real-time, event-driven).
- Dynamically calls external tools (DB, messaging, or third-party APIs).
- Maintains persistent memory for adaptive learning.

With this multi-agent design, your AgentOS becomes truly enterprise-grade—capable of tackling complex workflows, AI-driven decisions, and continuous improvement as you scale.
